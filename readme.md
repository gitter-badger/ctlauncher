> An unnecessary and exorbitant mod pack launcher for Minecraft and Forge.

# *FIRST PUSH HAS GOTTA WAIT*
I'll upload stuff soon enough. Tests and refactor is almost done.

## Introduction

The Crafting Table Launcher is a Just Becauseâ„¢ project. There are plenty of great mod pack launchers available for Minecraft. There was *no need what-so-ever* to make this. Honestly, I think wrote it as an Electron app just because I'm a bad person.

**A Mojang account from [Minecraft Java Edition](https://minecraft.net/) is required to play.**
